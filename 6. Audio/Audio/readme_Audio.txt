This code demonstrate the use of Audio chip SSM2603 of C5G.
(Cyclone V GX Starter Kit)

This code shows how to initilize the SSM2603 for Audio out
via I2C protocol. It gets the audio out by generating a
single tone from the chip.

This is just a demonstration for the begineers.
Changes may be needed to be used in a project. These can
be used for reference or to learn the basics of 
HDL and FPGA.
