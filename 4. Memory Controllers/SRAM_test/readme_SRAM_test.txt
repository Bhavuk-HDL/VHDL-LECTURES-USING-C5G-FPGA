This code demonstrate the use of SRAM of C5G.
(Cyclone V GX Starter Kit)

SWs used to Latch data and address to SRAM and to start Tx.
LEDs are used to display data and address.
Data as well as address is given from PC via UART.


Qsys is NOT used and the controller is developed
soft-wired.

This is just a demonstration for the begineers.
Changes may be needed to be used in a project. These can
be used for reference or to learn the basics of 
HDL and FPGA.
