This code demonstrate the use of SDRAM LPDDR2 of C5G.
(Cyclone V GX Starter Kit)

SWs and KEYs are used to send address and data to SDRAM.
LEDs are used to display data of a particular address.

Qsys is used to configure the cyclone V internal 
SDRAM controller, ie. controller is hard wired.

This is just a demonstration for the begineers.
Changes may be needed to be used in a project. These can
be used for reference or to learn the basics of 
HDL and FPGA.
