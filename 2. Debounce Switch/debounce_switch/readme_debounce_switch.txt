This code demonstrate the use of KEY in debounce of C5G.
(Cyclone V GX Starter Kit)

KEYs are mechanical switched so when we press it, it gives
us a few rises and falls before it gets to a stable state.
It is due to the debouncing effect.

This code counters that effects by taking a delay when we
are reading the KEY.

This is just a demonstration for the begineers.
Changes may be needed to be used in a project. These can
be used for reference or to learn the basics of 
HDL and FPGA.
