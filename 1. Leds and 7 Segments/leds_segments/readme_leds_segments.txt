This code demonstrate the use of clocks of C5G.
(Cyclone V GX Starter Kit)

Onboard LEDs and 7 segment display is used to show that.

Leds blink according to counter of one clock while
second clock is used to control Segment display.

This is just a demonstration for the begineers.
Changes may be needed to be used in a project. These can
be used for reference or to learn the basics of 
HDL and FPGA.
