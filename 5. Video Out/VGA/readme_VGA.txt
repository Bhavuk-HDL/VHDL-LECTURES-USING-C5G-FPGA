This code demonstrate the use of VGA through GPIO of C5G.
(Cyclone V GX Starter Kit)

This code shows how to get VGA output from C5G GPIOs.
only 3 bit video resolution is used for it but if you
want to use more resolution then you can add a ladder
circuit using registers to increase the resolution
according to your need.

This is just a demonstration for the begineers.
Changes may be needed to be used in a project. These can
be used for reference or to learn the basics of 
HDL and FPGA.
