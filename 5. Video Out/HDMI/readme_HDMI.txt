This code demonstrate the use of HDMI chip ADV7513 of C5G.
(Cyclone V GX Starter Kit)

This code shows how to initilize the ADV7513 for HDMI out
via I2C protocol.Output resolution is 1918x1079 with 
8 bits for defining RGB each.

This is just a demonstration for the begineers.
Changes may be needed to be used in a project. These can
be used for reference or to learn the basics of 
HDL and FPGA.
