This code demonstrate the use of UART FT232 of C5G.
(Cyclone V GX Starter Kit)

SWs and KEYs are used to send data to PC.

LEDs are used to display data Rx from PC and also
the data we send to Tx.

This is just a demonstration for the begineers.
Changes may be needed to be used in a project. These can
be used for reference or to learn the basics of 
HDL and FPGA.
