This code demonstrate the SPI protocol on C5G.
(Cyclone V GX Starter Kit)

Here 3 pins are used,
SEN to enable the slave chip.
SCLK as the clock for the chip.
SDATA to send the data to the chip.
CPOl and CPHA are 1 both (MODE 3).

This is just a demonstration for the begineers.
Changes may be needed to be used in a project. These can
be used for reference or to learn the basics of 
HDL and FPGA.
